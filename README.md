# Cloud Workload Forecasting Challenge

AI/ML take-home challenge built from the **Microsoft Azure Public Dataset V2** VM trace.

## Start here

1. Read [`ASSIGNMENT.md`](ASSIGNMENT.md).
2. Read [`DATASET.md`](DATASET.md).
3. Download the **`data-v1` GitHub Release** dataset and extract it as `challenge_data/`.
4. Read [`SUBMISSION.md`](SUBMISSION.md).
5. Implement your analysis and forecasting pipeline.

The challenge dataset is distributed as a GitHub Release rather than committed to the repository because it is intentionally large (targeting roughly 1.5 GB compressed).

## Dataset download

The hiring dataset is distributed as the fixed `data-v1` release of this repository.

**Download:** [Azure Dataset v1 Release](https://github.com/atomityhq/forecasting-challenge/releases/tag/data-v1)

Download `data-v1.tar.gz` from the release and extract it into the repository as `challenge_data/`:

```bash
mkdir -p challenge_data
tar -xzf data-v1.tar.gz -C challenge_data
```

The resulting layout is:

```text
challenge_data/
├── vm_cpu_readings.csv.gz
├── vm_metadata.csv.gz
├── DATA_CARD.md
└── SHA256SUMS
```

Verify the dataset before starting the assignment:

```bash
cd challenge_data
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
```

You should see:

```text
vm_cpu_readings.csv.gz: OK
vm_metadata.csv.gz: OK
DATA_CARD.md: OK
```

The release is a real, curated subset of the Microsoft Azure Public Dataset V2. It is not synthetic data.

The dataset contains 10,000 VMs with 134 CPU measurements per VM at five-minute intervals, for a total of 1,340,000 CPU observations.

Use the exact `data-v1` release provided for this assignment. Do not substitute another dataset or a different version of the Azure Public Dataset.

## What you are solving

The underlying data contains anonymized VM workload telemetry sampled every five minutes. Your job is to understand the workload and build a defensible forecasting pipeline for near-term aggregate demand.

The challenge is intentionally open-ended. We evaluate reasoning, time-series methodology, leakage prevention, error analysis, reproducibility, and the quality of your operational conclusions—not just model complexity.

## Expected environment

Python 3.11+ is recommended.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest -q
```

Model dependencies are intentionally not prescribed. Add only what you need and document them.

## Source

Microsoft Azure Public Dataset V2:

The official V2 documentation describes a 30-day VM trace with five-minute CPU readings, VM metadata, and encrypted subscription/deployment/VM identifiers. The full upstream trace is much larger than this challenge release.

## Submission

Submit your work as a repository or archive according to [`SUBMISSION.md`](SUBMISSION.md).
